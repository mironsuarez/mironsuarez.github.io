## How to ask Questions 

Asking a question seems simple, we’ve been asking questions our entire lives. But to really get help with whatever you are asking it’s better to ask a question the smart way especially when it comes to questions on software engineering. I am going to show two examples of questions taken from stack overflow. One is an example of what a smart question is and how we should be asking questions as developers. The other is a not so smart question and showcases what not to do when stuck.

## The Smart Question

The smart question is a question that is clear, simple to udersatnad and gets straight to the point. In this question the user was asking how to delet a Git branch locally and remotely. They also went on to provide their failed attepts at deleting a remote branch. You can see the question here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely

They were very clear with questions describing where it was happening. They even included what they were trying that was not working. This is a great example of a smart question  



## Conclusion

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.

*“The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul.” — Dieter F. Uchtdorf*

My interest in software engineering comes from the ability to create. Being able to take a thought and realize it into something not only tangible but useful is what excites me about software engineering. From a young age I’ve always loved to create whether it was building something physical, making short films, or capturing moments in time. My innate interest in creating is what brings me to my newest form of creation, software development.

So far, I’ve gained knowledge and some experience with several programing languages, including C, C++, Java, and my most recent endeavor Typescript. These languages have given me a strong starting point in being able to create applications. I’m interested in learning other software engineering technologies to bring my ideas to life.

My ultimate goal after graduating is to get a career started in the field of cybersecurity. Using my degree to further my position within the Air National Guard is another goal of mine. I am hopeful and excited to learn and grow in my technical abilities as I make my way through completing my education.

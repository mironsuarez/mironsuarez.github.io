## UI Frameworks
While we can do a lot with HTML and CSS, a UI framework introduces a new level of efficiency and productivity. UI frameworks give developers pre-designed layouts, reusable components, and responsive design tools. This means we don’t have to build a button from scratch every time we need to implement one. It also saves a significant amount of time since we don’t have to write specific code for webpages that might be viewed on devices other than a computer, such as tablets or phones. The responsive aspect of frameworks makes it easy to account for users on different devices and even different web browsers.

## Bootstrap
Bootstrap is one of the most popular frameworks used today. It was originally created by Twitter and later released as an open-source project on GitHub. It quickly became popular because of the simplicity it offered along with its responsiveness. One of its most powerful features is its grid system, which automatically adjusts based on the device a user is using. Below is an example of how it works. You can find more information at the [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/).

## My Thoughts
I enjoy learning and using Bootstrap. Although it can be frustrating to learn something new, I’d say Bootstrap is pretty user-friendly and not too difficult to pick up. It’s a really cool tool to learn and very impressive in how versatile it can be. I also think it makes creating a webpage much faster than trying to use HTML and CSS by themselves, and definitely far less complex. Below are two examples of different webpages created with Bootstrap. You can see how different they are and how unique you can make your own webpage.

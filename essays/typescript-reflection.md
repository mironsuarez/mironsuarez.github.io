*“The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul.” — Dieter F. Uchtdorf*

TypeScript so far is very enjoyable, and I hope it stays that way. It feels familiar because it closely resembles Java, which was the first programming language I learned. At times it can feel a bit tedious, especially since you have to explicitly define the type for nearly everything. While this can be somewhat annoying, it also has benefits. Keeping track of types and maintaining the correct syntax forces me to slow down and pay closer attention to details. This shift in focus, from speed to precision, is valuable because it builds a strong foundation for writing more reliable code. I’m excited to keep expanding my knowledge and skills in this language, and I like that I’m adding another tool to my growing set of technologies that I can use at my disposal.

As for the WODs, I have a love–hate relationship with them. On one hand, they are a powerful tool for assessing knowledge and identifying strengths and weaknesses in specific aspects of programming. The time pressure can feel stressful and even overwhelming at times, but it also exposes gaps in understanding that might otherwise go unnoticed. This challenge pushes me to prepare thoroughly and intentionally, which ultimately makes me a stronger programmer. Even though the experience can be intense, I find it enjoyable and rewarding.

The WODs not only build technical skills but also sharpen the ability to think critically under pressure and solve problems efficiently. These are skills that go beyond the classroom or practice sessions, they are exactly the kind of abilities that will be extremely useful in the real world of software engineering. Being able to quickly analyze a problem, identify a solution path, and implement it with confidence is a valuable habit, and I can already see how this style of practice is helping me develop it.

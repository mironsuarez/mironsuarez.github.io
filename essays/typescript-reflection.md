*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

My interest in software engineering began with a simple yet powerful realization: the ability to create. The idea that I could build something from scratch—something useful, impactful, and scalable—sparked a curiosity that quickly turned into a passion. Whether it's developing tools that streamline everyday tasks or designing systems that solve complex problems, the creative freedom and problem-solving nature of software engineering are what drew me in and continue to motivate me.

So far, I’ve gained experience in several programming languages, including C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript. These languages have given me a strong technical foundation and helped me explore different areas of software development. I'm particularly interested in building practical tools that provide real value—solutions that improve workflows, reduce friction, and ultimately make life easier for users. At the same time, I’m also fascinated by cybersecurity, both for its technical depth and its real-world impact on the systems we rely on every day.

Looking ahead, I want to deepen my understanding of the technologies and architectures that power modern software systems. One of my key goals is to learn how to efficiently choose the right tools for the right problems—an essential skill in a field that’s constantly evolving. Whether it’s backend frameworks, cloud infrastructure, or security protocols, I believe that having a strong grasp of the available options will allow me to build more effective and scalable solutions.

In the long term, my goal is to build something with a real-world use case—something that people can rely on and benefit from. I’m not just interested in writing code for its own sake; I want to create meaningful products that address genuine needs. Through continued learning, hands-on experience, and thoughtful collaboration, I hope to grow into a well-rounded software engineer capable of turning ideas into impactful technology.

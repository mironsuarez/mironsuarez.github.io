Coding stanndards, love them or hate them they are a must! Coding standards are a set of rules, guidlines and best practices that developers use when writing code. While it can be very annyoying and teidus to abiad by coding standards it is important to do so. These set of rule ensure consiittency, readabilit, and realiablity. All which are crusial to having a well devloped product. Coding standards are very much like grammar and punctuatuion rule in writing, as you can imaging without those two things it would make understanding what some one might write difficult to understand. There are also differnt style guides/rule sets for example for Javascript there is the popular Airbnb Javascript style guide and for python they have PEP 8 style guide. These guides are akin to what guides are followed when writing an essay such as using MLA or APA styles.

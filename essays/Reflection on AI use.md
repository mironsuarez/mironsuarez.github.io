# Reflecting on My Use of AI in ICS 314

## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly significant role in education, particularly in fields such as Software Engineering where problem-solving, debugging, and learning new technologies are constant demands. In ICS 314, AI tools became relevant not only as productivity aids but also as learning supports when used responsibly. Prior to this course, I had only casual experience using ChatGPT, primarily for general questions rather than structured academic work.

Throughout ICS 314, I made use of several AI tools including ChatGPT, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot. Overall, I found AI to be a very helpful learning aid, especially for debugging and understanding unfamiliar concepts. However, I also learned that AI can be harmful to learning if it is used only for copy-and-paste solutions rather than as a tool to support understanding. This reflection examines how I used AI across different course elements, its impact on my learning, and how AI-enhanced approaches compare to traditional methods.

## II. Personal Experience with AI in ICS 314

Below, I reflect on each major course element and how AI factored into my learning and work.

### Experience WODs (e.g., E18)
For Experience WODs, I intentionally tried not to use AI at first. My goal was to determine whether I could complete the WOD using my own knowledge and preparation. When I became genuinely stuck or when time constraints from other classes applied, I used AI to help unblock myself. In those cases, I would ask questions such as:

> “Explain why this JavaScript function is not behaving as expected.”

AI was useful as a last-resort support, but I found that relying on it too early reduced the challenge and learning value of the WOD.

---

### In-class Practice WODs
I generally avoided AI during in-class practice WODs. When I prepared properly beforehand, AI was unnecessary. However, if I came in unprepared, I sometimes used AI to clarify syntax or concepts quickly. This reinforced the importance of preparation, as AI was most helpful when supplementing not replacing prior knowledge.

---

### In-class (Graded) WODs
During graded, timed WODs, I sometimes used AI due to time pressure. However, I noticed that if I was unprepared, AI could actually slow me down, as interpreting and adapting responses took time. In these situations, AI was only beneficial when I already understood the topic at a high level.

---

### Essays
I rarely used AI for essays, but when I did, it was primarily for brainstorming, outlining, editing, or rewriting. For example:

> “Help me outline a reflection essay about effort estimation.”

AI helped organize ideas, but I ensured that all final writing reflected my own thoughts and experiences.

---

### Final Project (Club Oven Lovin’)
AI played a significant role in my final project. I used it extensively for:
- Debugging issues  
- Breaking down features  
- Resolving Prisma and Next.js errors  
- Fixing ESLint and Playwright failures  
- Assisting with writing and refactoring code  

Example prompts included:

> “Why is this Prisma migration failing?”  
> “Fix the ESLint errors in this file.”

AI was extremely useful here, but most outputs required modification to fit the project’s specific structure.

---

### Learning a Concept or Tutorial
AI acted as a tutor or mentor when learning new technologies such as Prisma, Next.js routing, Playwright, ESLint, React hooks, Underscore, and functional programming. For example:

> “Explain how Prisma migrations and seeding work.”

This use of AI significantly improved my conceptual understanding.

---

### Answering a Question in Class or Discord
AI was helpful when preparing answers to class or Discord questions, especially when I was unfamiliar with the topic. It helped me clarify my understanding before responding.

---

### Asking or Answering a Smart Question
I did not meaningfully engage in asking or answering “smart questions” using AI during this course.

---

### Coding Examples
On rare occasions, I asked AI for example code to better understand a concept, such as functional programming patterns. These examples were used as references rather than final solutions.

---

### Explaining Code
I frequently asked AI to explain code written by myself or others, which helped me understand logic flows and identify mistakes.

---

### Writing Code
I used AI to generate starter code, fix errors, and refactor existing code. Sometimes the generated code worked perfectly; other times it required significant modification. Understanding when and how to adjust AI output was an important skill I developed.

---

### Documenting Code
AI assisted with writing comments and documentation, helping improve clarity and consistency.

---

### Quality Assurance
I relied heavily on AI for quality assurance tasks, especially for:
- ESLint errors  
- Playwright test failures  
- Runtime and logic errors  

Prompts like:

> “What’s wrong with this code?”

were particularly effective.

---

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI generally improved my understanding, particularly when I was already stuck and needed guidance. However, it could also reduce learning if used incorrectly, such as copying solutions without analysis. In some cases, AI responses were confusing or incorrect, requiring careful verification.

One clear benefit was learning about databases, including how to structure tables and how migrations and seeding work. AI explanations made these abstract concepts more accessible.

---

## IV. Practical Applications Outside ICS 314

Outside of ICS 314, I have used AI in other courses such as physics and calculus to help understand difficult concepts. I also use AI for general problem-solving and clarification in everyday contexts, demonstrating its broader educational value.

---

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

The main challenges I encountered included:
- Temptation to over-rely on AI  
- Incorrect or outdated code  
- Overconfidence in wrong answers  

These limitations highlight the need for critical thinking and verification when using AI.

---

## VI. Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs. AI-Enhanced Learning

Compared to traditional learning methods, AI significantly reduced frustration, as it eliminated hours spent searching for explanations. However, it sometimes reduced retention, since copying solutions can bypass deeper understanding. On the positive side, AI’s accessibility encouraged exploration of difficult topics that might otherwise feel overwhelming.

---

## VII. Future Considerations

AI use in software engineering education should be encouraged, integrated into assignments, and treated like a debugger or reference tool. The ability to use AI effectively is likely to become a valuable skill that employers look for in the future.

---

## VIII. Conclusion

Overall, AI played a meaningful role in my experience in ICS 314. When used responsibly, it enhanced learning, reduced frustration, and supported problem-solving. However, misuse can hinder understanding and retention. Moving forward, AI should be viewed as a powerful supplement to learning rather than a shortcut.

**AI is best used as an extension of the mind, not as a replacement for thinking.**
